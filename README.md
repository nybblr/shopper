Nothing special: just my repo of Photoshop/Illustrator scripts and the like for when I go 'shopping.

Export Groups
-------------

Something that really ought to be included with Photoshop: exporting the current PSD's top level groups to PNG, nicely trimmed with transparency. Great if you need to splice up a document (and aren't awesome enough to design image-free).

To use it, open up your document and group things around so that top level groups are what you want to export. Just double click the script and it'll automatically start saving to `/export` in the directory of the current PSD.
